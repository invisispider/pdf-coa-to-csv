## üöÄ About This Project

This project showcases my ability to build practical Python tools that automate data extraction and transformation tasks ‚Äî turning messy inputs like scanned PDFs into structured datasets ready for analysis.  

If you need someone who can bridge raw operational data to BI dashboards or machine learning pipelines, I create solutions like this: efficient, reproducible, and business-ready.

Why This Matters
This project demonstrates:

Custom Python ETL development

Automated data extraction from complex file types

Clean, reproducible, and version-controlled workflows

Outputs ready for analysis, reporting, or dashboard integration

If you need a developer who can design and implement Python solutions for analytics, reporting, and data engineering, this is the kind of work I deliver.

Future Improvements
Add a simple web or GUI front-end

Integrate cloud or database storage

Add error reporting and logs

Expand to handle other document types

Would you like me to prepare the actual `README.md` file content for copy-paste, or should I generate companion files (like `requirements.txt`) to go with it?
